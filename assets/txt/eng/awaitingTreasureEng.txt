awaiting treasure

Time will measure
whether a treasure
that’s been kept hidden
for many years to come
brings at least some
comfort to the surface.
That’s where our journey will begin
it will not necessarily mean
anything to you at first.
If it’s your lucky day
one moment after another you may
discover what was waiting for you.
I cannot unveil your mask
it is naturally your task
to find out for yourself.
Ready? Set! Wait…
